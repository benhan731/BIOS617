## JITT: ``A fundamental identity in statistics'' - X.L. Meng


## Two Phase Sampling

* All of discussions of design that use auxiliary data assume that
we have this data at the population level
  + Stratification
  + Post-stratification, calibration
  + Ratio, regression estimation
* It settings where auxiliary variables are
  + Not available
  + Cheap to collect relative to main data of interest
  + Highly predictive of the main data of interest
then it might be worthwhile to conduct two-phase (double)
sampling.

## Examples

1.  Screening for a rare population (extreme case): use cheap
method of sampling (mail, telephone) to identify members
of a rare population for (face-to-face) follow-up.
2. Allocate the first-phase sample to strata, and subsample
proportionately or disproportionately from these strata at
the second phase.
3. Allocate the first-phase sample to clusters, and sample the
clusters at the second phase.
4. Select an epsem sample of clusters, obtain measures of size
for the sampled clusters, and take the second-phase sample
of clusters by PP(e)S.
5. Select a first-phase sample of clusters, list the elements in
the selected clusters, and then take a second-phase sample
of elements from the constructed list.

## After the first phase

Once the “first phase” data are available, they can be used for
stratification, ratio estimation, regression estimation, or
poststratification for the “second phase” of data collection.

* Because resources are used in the first phase, costs usually
have to be considered before implementing a two-phase
design.
* Since gains from auxiliary information are typically
modest, large cost differentials are required for two-phase
sampling to be more efficient that a one-phase design.

## Stratified Two-Phase Sampling

* Take a first phase sampling of $n^\prime$ elements from a populatoin via SRS
* Allocate the sampled elements to the $h=1,\ldots,H$ strata
* Sample $n_h \leq n_h^\prime$ elements from the $h$th stratum via SRS
* Estimate is $\bar y_{ds} = \sum_{h=1}^H p_h \bar y_h$ for 
  + $p_h = n_h^\prime / n^\prime$ 
  + $\bar y_h = n_h^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n_h} y_{hi}$
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
E ( \bar y_{ds} ) &= E ( E ( \bar y_{ds} \mid n_h^\prime ) ) = E \left( \sum_{h=1}^H p_h E ( \bar y_h \mid n_h^\prime ) \right) \\
&=  \sum_{h=1}^H E \left( p_h \right) \bar Y_h
\end{aligned}
$$
